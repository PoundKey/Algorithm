## What is an Algorithm?

__Definition__: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions such that

- Each step must be stated in an completely unambigious fashion.
- The result of the algorithm only depends on the input and results of previous steps.
- There are no infinite loops.
- Basically, it's all about the __logic__ of telling stories. Focus, stay cool, stay calmed, and don't be an IBM (International Big Month).
