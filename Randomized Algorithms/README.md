# Randomized Algorithms

- __Key Idea__: Modify divide-and-conquer algorithms to reduce their worst-case running time by making the divide-step random.
- __Implication__: As we are no longer using a deterministic way to divide a given problem size into sub-problems, we now have to consider the expectation values of random variables in order to analyze the expected time spent on recursive calls.
