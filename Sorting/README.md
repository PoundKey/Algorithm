# Sorting

### Measure Sorting Algorithms
- Computational __complexity__ (eg. Runtime)
	- Worst case, Average case, Best case
- __Stability__: What happens to elements with identical keys?
- __Memory Usage__: How much extra memory is used

### Insertion Sort
>__Definition__: At the start of iteration i, the first i elements in the array are sorted, and we insert the (i+1)st element into its proper place.
