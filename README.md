=========
 - Rock the brain and play some algorithms, starting from _bolts and nuts_.
 - _Rolling in the deep_, I am very serious.

## What is an Algorithm?

__Formal Definition__: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions such that

- Each step must be stated in an completely unambigious fashion.
- The result of the algorithm only depends on the input and results of previous steps.
- There are no infinite loops.
- Basically, it's all about the __logic__ of telling stories. Focus, stay cool, stay calmed, and don't be an IBM (International Big Month).

_Long Story Short_: Algorithm is all about doing _CRUD_ operations upon certain _Data Structures_. 

Yep, nothing more mysterious nor miserable than that, right...?
